NOTE: I made this repository as a collection of my own improvements and tweaks
to ACF admin styling over the years. I was only concerned with my own usage,
which is why there is no README or documentation. I am unaware of anyone else
ever using it. I have thought about making it a better public resource by
providing documentation and examples of how it works, but have not made time for
that. I may at some point in the future, but don't have time right now. Feel
free to dig into the code and see if anything works for you. Thanks!
